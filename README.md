- Developed data-driven credit risk model to predict probabilities of default (PD) and assigned credit scores to existing or potential borrowers using data includes information on over 450k consumer loans issued between 2007 and 2014 with 75 features.

- Performed feature selection using Chi-squared test for categorical features, ANOVA F-Statistic for numerical features, feature engineering using Weight of Evidence (WoE) and Information Value (IV), developed logistic regression model, and evaluated using AUROC. 

- Implemented credit risk scorecard to calculate individual credit scores and determine whether to approve or reject loans.
